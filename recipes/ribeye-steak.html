    <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Two 1 1/4 pound, bone-in rib eye steaks</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>4 thyme sprigs</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>1 rosemary sprig</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Steps:</strong></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season the rib eye steaks all over with salt and freshly grounded
        pepper. <br />
        Let the meat stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large cast iron-skillet, heat the canola oil until shimmering. Add
        the steaks <br />
        and cook over high heat until crusty on the bottom, about 5 minutes.
        Turn the <br />
        steaks and add butter, thyme, garlic and rosemary to the skillet. Cook
        over <br />
        high heat, basting the steaks with the melted butter, garlic and herbs,
        until the <br />
        steaks are medium-rare, 5 to 7 minutes longer. Transfer the steaks to a
        cutting <br />
        board and let rest for 10 minutes. Cut the steaks off the bone, then
        slice the meat <br />
        across the grain and serve.
